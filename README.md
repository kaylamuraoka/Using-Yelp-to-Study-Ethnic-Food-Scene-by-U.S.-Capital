# Using-Yelp-to-Study-Ethnic-Food-Scene-by-U.S.-Capital
In this project, I scraped Yelp restaurant data to investigate the food scene across different U.S capitals. This project helps us gain insight on geographic taste preferences through analyzing how different types of food are consumed across different places. This project compares the frequency of mexican, american, korean, japanese, italian, chinese, thai, mediterranean, indian, vietnamese, latin, french, filipino, greek, and hawaiian restaurants in the users home state. I created this code that ultimately prints a bar chart and pie chart to easily visualize this data. This code also recommends highly rated restaurant located in the user's home state.
